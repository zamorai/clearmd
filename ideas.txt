Let me know if you want me to expand on any of these areas!

Based on the code and the website's goal of providing salary transparency for medical professionals, here's a suggested expansion of pages and components:
1. Career Insights Page

Interactive tool where users can:

Calculate take-home pay
Resources Hub
Specialty Deep Dives
Detailed pages for each specialty (expanding on the structure in DetailedCompensationView.tsx lines 33-96)
Training requirements
Subspecialty comparisons

Fellowship impact on compensation
Community Features
Anonymous discussion forums by specialty
Salary review submission guidelines
